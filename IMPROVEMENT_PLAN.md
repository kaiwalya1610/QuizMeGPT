# Improvement Plan for QuizMeGPT

## Overview and Goals

- **Primary Goal:**  
  Enhance the product by enabling users to interactively visualize mathematical concepts, proofs, and research paper structures through dynamic graphs and diagrams.

- **Key Objectives:**  
  1. **Interactive Graph Integration:** Allow users to explore math concepts via zoomable, draggable, and adjustable graphs (e.g., concept maps, flow diagrams, networks).  
  2. **Research Paper Annotation:** Enable interactive overlays on research paper content that highlight and annotate complex mathematical ideas.  
  3. **Gamified Learning:** Integrate these visualizations into the quiz workflow so that learning becomes engaging and fun.  
  4. **User-Driven Exploration:** Empower users to manipulate graphs (filter, adjust, and explore connections) to better understand difficult topics.

## Feature Breakdown and Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Interactive Graph Integration

- **Library Integration:**  
  - Select a robust JavaScript visualization library such as D3.js, Chart.js, or Plotly.  
  - Integrate this library into the extension by adding it to the manifest and popup HTML.

- **Graph Generation Module:**  
  - **Input:** Use quiz content or math-related topics as input data.  
  - **Visualization:** Create a module that generates an interactive graph where:  
    - **Nodes:** Represent key mathematical concepts or steps in a theorem.  
    - **Edges:** Illustrate relationships (e.g., dependencies, logical flows).  
  - **Controls:** Provide zoom, pan, and filter functions.  
  - **Interaction:** Allow users to click on nodes for additional details (e.g., pop-up definitions or animated derivations).

- **UI Integration:**  
  - Add a new option or button in the existing UI (e.g., in the popup or options page) to toggle the interactive graph view.  
  - Seamlessly transition between the quiz interface and the visualization module.

### Phase 2: Interactive Research Paper Explorer

- **Research Paper Analysis:**  
  - Allow users to upload or input research paper excerpts.  
  - Use natural language processing (NLP) techniques or lightweight algorithms to extract:  
    - Mathematical formulas  
    - Key definitions and theorems  
    - Logical steps in complex proofs

- **Graph Annotation and Overlay:**  
  - Convert extracted elements into nodes on an interactive graph.  
  - Draw edges to represent logical progressions and dependencies.  
  - Overlay the interactive graph onto the research paper text (or use a split-screen view).

- **Engagement Enhancements:**  
  - Include buttons such as “Explain in Depth” that generate further interactive details using existing quiz/explanation mechanics.  
  - Allow users to reconfigure the layout (e.g., focusing on specific sections of the research paper).

### Phase 3: Gamification and Learning Flow

- **Unified Learning Dashboard:**  
  - Create a dedicated dashboard where users can select between:  
    - Quiz Practice (current feature)  
    - Interactive Graph Exploration for math concepts  
    - Research Paper Annotation mode

- **Adaptive Difficulty:**  
  - Adjust quiz difficulty and graph complexity based on user performance and exploration behavior.  
  - Introduce awards or visual badges as users master new topics.

- **Feedback and Iteration:**  
  - Embed interactive feedback loops within the graphs (e.g., “Did you understand this concept?” buttons).  
  - Integrate with the deep explanation functionality to provide more context for selected graph nodes.

## Detailed Implementation Steps

1. **Library and Environment Setup:**
   - Update `manifest.json` and related files to include the chosen visualization library.
   - Add necessary scripts and stylesheets to support interactive graph features.

2. **Develop the Visualization Module:**
   - Create a new JavaScript module (e.g., `graphModule.js`) that:
     - Loads the visualization library.
     - Accepts input data (quiz questions, key math concepts, or extracted research content).
     - Renders the interactive graph.
     - Adds event listeners for node interactions.

3. **Create Research Paper Annotation:**
   - Develop a parsing function to extract mathematical notations and key content from research papers.
   - Generate an interactive overlay or a side-by-side view that links parsed data to graph elements.

4. **Integrate UI Changes:**
   - Modify the popup HTML (or create a dedicated dashboard) with mode selection buttons.
   - Ensure smooth transitions between the quiz interface and the new interactive modes.
   - Update CSS as needed for graph and overlay styling.

5. **Testing and Iteration:**
   - Conduct user tests focusing on:
     - Navigation ease
     - Interactivity and responsiveness
     - Clarity of explanations
   - Iterate on graph responsiveness and annotation accuracy based on user feedback.

6. **Documentation and Tutorials:**
   - Provide on-screen guides and documentation within the extension to help users utilize the new features.
   - Create interactive tutorials (using the deep explanation feature) to explain how to use interactive graphs and the research paper explorer.

## Next Steps

- Finalize feature prioritization and begin development.
- Gather user feedback and iterate on the design for further refinements.
